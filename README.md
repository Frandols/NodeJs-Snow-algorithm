# Snow Algorithm
**NodeJs**

###### Run $node snow_algo_es.js or $node snow_algo_en.js on terminal.

This algorithm resolves a situation where you give it different columns 
with different heights and it calculates where the snow should fall in 
a real situation.

Anyway, you can also use the version with UI (User Interface) that I made
with React and Bootstrap, look for it on my repositories!


***Remember that you need to have NodeJs installed on your computer!***
